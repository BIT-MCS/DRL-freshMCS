        Args:
            eps_final: The final epsilon value to decay to (The final base
                value if using per-actor exponent). Can also be a list of
                values in which case <eps_prob> must be a list of the same size
                summing up to 1.0 and defines the probability to use each
                eps_final value. This allows to achieve exploration as in the
                A3C paper with different minimums.
            exploration_fraction: The fraction of the training period in [0,1]
                over which to decay the epsilon value
            eps_prob: Required only if eps_final is a list and not a single
                value, in this case this is also a list of the same size
                summing up to 1.0
            eps_start: The starting epsilon value at time=0
            eps_min: The absolute minimal epsilon value to use, even if
                per-actor exponentiation resulted in a lower value.
            per_actor_exponent_factor: If >0 uses an exponentially lowered
                epsilon per actor as in the APEX paper (In this case
                total_actors must be initialized, greater than 1, and
                actor_indices must be passed in to remap_actions()).
                In this case typically eps_start can equal eps_final (In the
                APEX paper it's eps_start=eps_final=0.4, with
                per_actor_exponent_factor=7), or eps_final can be also be lower
                to ensure more actors follow policy more often towards the end
